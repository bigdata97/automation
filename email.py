Subject: Request for Consideration – Continued Opportunities at CVS via Ascendion

Dear [Engineering Leader's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

I’m currently working with CVS Health through Ascendion Inc., and my present assignment is scheduled to conclude on July 18th. It’s been a great experience contributing to the team here, and I’m very enthusiastic about the work being done across the engineering organization at CVS.

I’m presently working under the leadership of Muralikrishna from Ascendion Inc., and this engagement has provided me valuable exposure to CVS’s platforms, engineering culture, and cross-functional collaboration.

I would also like to highlight that I am a Google Cloud Certified Engineer, with strong expertise in:

BigQuery, Cloud Composer, Dataflow, Dataproc, Spanner, and Pub/Sub

Vertex AI Search & Chat, Apache Spark, Kafka

Monitoring and alerting tools like Grafana and OpsGenie

Given my background, experience, and familiarity with CVS’s systems, I would be truly grateful if you could consider me for any upcoming or existing opportunities within your team or across the broader CVS engineering organization.

I’d be happy to share my resume or discuss further if there’s a potential fit. Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,
[Your Full Name]
[Your Current Role – e.g., Data Engineer | CVS via Ascendion Inc.]
