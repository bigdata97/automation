# 🌐 Cloud Composer (Airflow on GCP) – Architecture, Use Case, and Best Practices

That’s a great initiative! **Cloud Composer** is a fully managed workflow orchestration service built on **Apache Airflow**, and understanding its architecture will help you effectively design, deploy, and monitor your data pipelines in GCP.

## 1. Cloud Composer Architecture Overview

Cloud Composer is a fully managed workflow orchestration service built on Apache Airflow. It enables you to author, schedule, and monitor pipelines that span across cloud and on-premises environments.

```

### Key Components

- **DAGs**: Python scripts defining workflows.
- **Airflow Scheduler**: Schedules tasks from DAGs.
- **Kubernetes Workers**: Run your actual task logic.
- **Cloud SQL**: Stores metadata like DAG runs, task states.
- **Cloud Logging**: Stores logs from all Airflow components.
- **Cloud Storage**: Hosts DAGs, plugins, and other resources.

## 2. End-to-End Use Case: GCS → Dataflow → BigQuery

### Scenario

You want to automate a data pipeline that:

1. Picks up a file from GCS
2. Triggers a Dataflow template to transform the data
3. Loads results into BigQuery

### Sample DAG (Python)


```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.dataflow import DataflowTemplatedJobStartOperator
from airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.bigquery import BigQueryInsertJobOperator
from airflow.utils.dates import days_ago

with DAG(
    dag_id="etl_gcs_to_bigquery",
    start_date=days_ago(1),
    schedule_interval="@daily",
    catchup=False,
) as dag:

    start_dataflow = DataflowTemplatedJobStartOperator(
        task_id="run_dataflow",
        template="gs://my-bucket/templates/my-dataflow-template",
        parameters={{
            "inputFile": "gs://my-bucket/input.csv",
            "outputTable": "project.dataset.table"
        }},
        location="us-central1",
        project_id="my-project"
    )

    load_to_bigquery = BigQueryInsertJobOperator(
        task_id="load_to_bq",
        configuration={{
            "query": {{
                "query": "SELECT * FROM project.dataset.table WHERE processed = TRUE",
                "useLegacySql": False
            }}
        }}
    )

    start_dataflow >> load_to_bigquery
```

## 3. Cloud Composer Best Practices

### DAG Design & Structure

| Practice | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **Keep DAG files lightweight** | DAG files are parsed frequently. Move logic into modules. |
| **Use `taskflow` API** | Cleaner syntax, built-in XComs |
| **Avoid dynamic DAGs inside files** | Leads to scheduler bloat |
| **Unique `dag_id`** | Prevents conflicts |
| **Use Airflow variables and connections** | Avoid hardcoded config |

---

### Task Design

| Practice | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| **Idempotent tasks** | Safe retries |
| **Avoid long-running tasks** | Better observability |
| **Use retries and backoff** | Handles flaky errors |
| **Set timeouts** | Avoid zombie tasks |
| **Use `execution_date` properly** | Needed for backfills & schedule-aware logic |

---

### Environment Management

| Practice | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| **Use Composer v2** | Better performance, scalability |
| **Pin dependency versions** | Avoid breaking changes |
| **Use separate envs for dev/test/prod** | Safer deployments |
| **Use Git for DAG version control** | CI/CD and traceability |
| **Avoid too many DAGs** | Scheduler performance hit |

---

### Monitoring & Logging

| Practice | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| **Use email/Slack alerts** | Quick error awareness |
| **Use `log.info()` instead of `print()`** | Structured logs in Cloud Logging |
| **Retry alerts** | Get notified before SLA misses |
| **Export logs to BigQuery** | Long-term monitoring & auditability |

---

### Security & Permissions

| Practice | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| **Use impersonated service accounts** | Principle of least privilege |
| **Limit Composer service account perms** | Reduces blast radius |
| **Use Secret Manager** | Don't hardcode secrets |
| **Secure Airflow UI** | Enable IAP or restrict via IAM |

---

### Performance & Scaling

| Practice | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| **Tune scheduler/workers** | Prevent backlogs |
| **Use Dataflow/Cloud Run for heavy jobs** | Don’t overload Composer |
| **Offload big data tasks** | Composer is orchestrator, not processor |

---

### DevOps / CI-CD Tips

| Practice | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| **Lint DAGs with flake8/pylint** | Prevent bugs before deploy |
| **Automate deploy via Cloud Build** | Safer, faster DAG release cycle |
| **Use `airflow dags test` locally** | Faster feedback loop |

---

### Helpful Tools

| Tool | Use |
|------|-----|
| `airflow dags test` | DAG testing locally |
| Cloud Build | DAG deployment automation |
| IAM + IAP | Secure Airflow UI |
| Cloud Logging + BigQuery | Monitor + analyze task runs |
